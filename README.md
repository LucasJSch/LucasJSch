# Hi, I'm Lucas Scheinkerman! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Software Engineer from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Currently working as Robotics Simulation Engineer @ [Unreal Empowerment](https://unrealempowerment.com/), helping to simulate the (yet) Unreal!

Always looking for new awesome technical challenges, eager to learn new things and do meaningful work that impacts positively in our world.
I love to learn new stuff, understand how complex systems work, and transform theoretical ideas into real things. Translated into my work, I love all aspects of
complex systems design and implementation.

From coding low-level C routines, to solving high-level problems using the most suitable data structures and algorithms, I find exciting each and everyone of the layers.
